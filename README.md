# Term-3-AI


# Day 1
Develop a machine learning model to predict the total dollar amount that customers 
are willing to pay while purchasing a car given the following attributes

Customer Name
Customer e-mail
Country
Gender
Age
Annual Salary
Credit Card Debt
Net Worth
Car Purchase Amount
Use the given dataset to perform the followings tasks:
Car_Purchasing_Data.csv

Analyze the dataset by implementing the following operations using pandas:
Import the dataset
Display the first 5 rows of the dataset (head)
Display the last 5 rows of the dataset (tail)
Determine the shape of the dataset (shape - Total number of rows and columns)
Display the concise summary of the dataset (info)
Check the null values in dataset (isnull)
Get overall statistics about dataset (describe)
Identify the library to plot the graph to understand the relations among the various columns to select the independent variables (Input), target variables (output) and irrelevant features.

# Day2

Create the input dataset from the original dataset by dropping the irrelevant features
Create the output dataset from the original dataset.
Transform the input dataset into a percentage based weighted value between 0 and 1.
Transform the output dataset into a percentage based weighted value between 0 and 1.
[Hint: for output dataset it may require to reshape it first}
Split the dataset into the training set and test set
Print the shape of train and test set data set
Print the first few rows from the train and test data set

# Day 3
Work with Models

Identify the type of output for the output variable (regression or classification) and select the required (Regression) models
Import and Initialize the Models
Train the model with training sets
Prediction on the test/validation data
Evaluate model performance
Display the evaluation results
Choose the best model
Plot the bar chart to visualize the best model among all
Retrain the model on entire dataset
